# Sublime Text snippets

These are [Sublime Text snippets](http://docs.sublimetext.info/en/latest/extensibility/snippets.html) I use for day-to-day work, much of which involves editing kramdown in the [Electric Book workflow](http://electricbook.works).

For how to install and edit snippets in Sublime, [this is a great article](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/a-guide-to-preserving-your-wrists-with-sublime-text-snippets-7541662a53f2).

## Usage

In short, save any snippet to `/Sublime Text 3/Packages/User`. This location may vary by operating system and machine. On my Windows machine it's `C:\Users\Arthur\AppData\Roaming\Sublime Text 3\Packages\User`.

To use a Sublime Text snippet, you type a particular series of characters then hit tab to trigger the snippet. For each of these, read its `tabTrigger` to know what to type.
