# Sublime Text snippets

These are [Sublime Text snippets](http://docs.sublimetext.info/en/latest/extensibility/snippets.html) I use for day-to-day work, much of which involves editing kramdown in the [Electric Book workflow](http://electricbook.works).

## Usage

Copy the `.sublime-snippets` files into your Sublime Text `Packages/User` folder. 

As normal with Sublime Text snippets, you type a series of characters then hit tab to trigger the snippet. For each of these, read its `tabTrigger` to know what to type.
